## Minigame Ideas

### Don't tap the White Tile clone

Themes:
- Piano Keys
- Dance Floor

### Side Scrolling Shooter
- Accelerometer Controls
- Left-to-Right Run & Gun

### Timed Tap/Click Game
Run a timer until a tap/click, timer closes to target wins.

Themes:
- Roulette
- Stop the sword
- Drop item, click to catch

### Impossible Game
But shorter

### Digging Game
Click the screen to "scratch" away top sprites revealing second layer.
First to reveal specific portion wins.

Themes:

### Tap to Shoot Ducks
Duck Hunt?

### Marble Maze
Like the old wooden ones (would have to use the accelerometer)

### Cookie Clicker
CLICK IT! MOAR! FASTSER!

Themes:
- Piano Theme (Instraments in general)
- Cheers and boos for win/lose conditions

### Slingshot
Angry Birds -ish

### Slap Monkey
I guess you just swipe the screen?

### Whack-a-Mole
Tap the animals, it's like petting but a biiit more agressive

Themes:
- Whack-a-Gopher
  - I had this idea that maybe the holes belong to the moles, and the gophers stole them. So the moles have hired you to ~~kill~~ ~~destroy~~ relocate the gophers 

### Memory Tile Game
Themes:
- Memory Tiles
- Grocery Store Isles
  - Match items to isles

### Store Bagger
Oddly shaped items are given to you to place inside of an oddly shaped bag.
Every one gets the same bags and items, whoever packs the most wins.

### Drag the Mouse Maze
Not sure how this might translate to mobile

### Type Gibberish Game
Mash the keyboard as fast as you can.

### Spin the Basketball
Swiper keep Swiping

### Swipe Lock
Mix of simon says and a regular phone swipe lock.
Animations plays, you copy, becomes exponentially more difficult .

### Price is Right
Probably limited to 3-4 letter words.

### Catch the fruit
Like the mini game in Kirby 64.

### Target Range
Point Blank mini clone.

### Fill the cup
Fill a cup by tapping on the dispenser, if it overfills, the cup is thrown away.
Whoever fills the most cups wins.

### Top Down Driving
##### Avoid the Pedestrians
Don't hit the people!

##### Run Over Zombies
HIT THE ~~PEOPLE~~ ZOMBIES!

### Plinko
This game is funny because it's all random, you really can't choose much.

### Skiball
Swipe in a direction to get the ball in hole (like most sports).

### Shaker
Shake the phone as much as possible. 

You may be thinking .
> "Won't my group of familiar humans look ~~stuuu~~ dumb shaking their phones around?"

> Yes.
